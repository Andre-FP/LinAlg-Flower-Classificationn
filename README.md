# Linear Algebra - Flower Classification from scratch

Flower classification done with least squares regression implemented from scratch.
The least squares regression matrix theory was applied, with the linear system solved using matrix decomposition methods such as PLR and QR.

## Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
