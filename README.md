# Linear Algebra - Flower Classification from scratch

Flower classification made using least squares regression implemented from scratch.
The least squares regression matrix theory was applied, with the linear system solved using matrix decomposition methods such as PLU and SVD.

## Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
